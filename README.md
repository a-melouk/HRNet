# Project title: HRNet

# jQuery version: https://a-melouk.github.io/oc-Hr-net/

# Front-end

## Description

This project aims to convert HRnet, an internal web application used for managing employee records, from jQuery to React. The current application is outdated and has been causing significant bugs and an increase in internal complaints. The development team has been working on upgrading the application for some time now, and the management has finally approved the conversion to React.

The main issues with HRnet are related to the date pickers, modal windows, dropdown menus, and tables. The project will involve creating custom React components to replace the existing third-party jQuery plugins used in the user interface. The goal is to improve performance and stability by converting these jQuery plugins into React components.
